## Objective
- “Guess a Number” practices number sequencing and mental counting. 
- It teaches more abstract thinking as a child has no visual aid to guide them. 
- This is a great game to play.

## guess_the_number.py
- This game has two modes, easy and hard
- In easy mode, user gets 10 attempts to predict the number
- In hard mode, user gets 05 attempts to predict the number
- If the number entered by user is low, "Too low" output is shown on screen
- If the number entered by user is high, "Too high" output is shown on screen
- If the number entered by user is correct, "That's a perfect guess" output is shown on screen
- If the number of attempts done by user exceeds, "You are out of attempts" and the correct answer is shown on screen
