## Objective
- The goal of this project is to build an interactive game in which the user needs to type all the 50 states of America.

## main.py
- Displays a political map of the United States on the screen.
- When a user types the right name of a state in the dialog box, the name of that specific state appears on the map.
- When a user types "Exit" in the dialog box, the game is terminated. A csv file is saved, containing information on the states that were not predicted by the user.

## 50_states.csv
- The coordinates of every one of America's 50 states are included.

## states_to_learn.csv
- The names of the states that the user must memorize are listed here.

## blank_states_img.gif
- Contains the political map of United States.
- **Note - Only pictures with the.gif extension are supported by the Turtle library.**
