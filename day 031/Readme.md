## Objective
- This project's goal is to build a flash card game that kids can use to learn any new language.

## main.py
- A graphical user interface is constructed using tkinter, with a canvas size of 526 × 800 in which the words will be displayed. 
- When the user presses the play button, a window with a French term appears on the screen.
- The user will be given three seconds to estimate the answer, and the answer to that French term will be revealed on the screen in English language after three seconds.
