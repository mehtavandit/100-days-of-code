## Objective
- Today's aim is to practice implementing the remaining three methods of the requests module, namely post(), put(), and delete(), using the pixela API.

## main.py
- Pixela API is a Japanese developer's creation that is used to track habits.
- New user can be created using the post() method of requests module.
- When a new user is registered, a graph with a unique id is generated to monitor the person's distinct habit.
- Using the post() method, a value corresponding to a certain date in the graph can be inserted.
- The put() function of the request module can be used to update the value entered.
- A value can be erased by using the delete() function in the request module.
