## Objective
- The aim of this game is to make sure that turtle crosses the path without colliding with any cars.

##main.py
- Create a 600*600 pixel screen.
- The collision between the automobile and the turtle is detected.
- The turtle returns to the starting line as soon as it crosses the finish line, and the next level begins.

## player.py
- A turtle is generated and placed at position (0,-280) with its head set to 90 degrees.
- Functions up() and down() are defined that cause the turtle to move forward and downward when the up and down arrows are pressed, respectively.
- The function is_at_finish_line() determines if the turtle has reached the finish line and returns true when it has, otherwise false.
